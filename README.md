I build tools for people who teach developers. The platform I create powers courses from world-class educators:

|                                                     |                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**AI Hero**](https://aihero.dev)                   | Matt Pocock's AI engineering course — prompt engineering, evals, RAG, agents |
| [**Epic AI**](https://epicai.pro)                   | Kent C. Dodds on architecting intelligent experiences with MCP               |
| [**Total TypeScript**](https://totaltypescript.com) | The industry standard for learning TypeScript                                |

### Currently Building

- **[joelclaw](https://joelclaw.com)** — a personal AI operating system. Always-on Mac Mini running durable agent loops, event-driven pipelines, and a composable skill system. [68 ADRs](https://github.com/joelhooks/joelclaw) and counting.
- **Agent-first CLIs** — tools that speak HATEOAS JSON so AI agents can operate them without scraping text
- **Multi-agent workflows** — not vibe coding, but structured pipelines that actually ship

### Open Source

| [**course-builder**](https://github.com/skillrecordings/course-builder) | The platform behind all the courses above |

### π Skills

Skills are portable knowledge modules for AI coding agents — structured prompts, workflows, and tool integrations that extend what agents can do:

| Skill | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| **video-ingest** | Download → transcribe → archive → Vault note pipeline |
| **gateway** | Operate always-on agent daemons with Telegram, Redis, webhooks |
| **k8s** | Manage Talos Linux clusters on Mac Mini |
| **email-triage** | Inference-based inbox triage — scan, categorize, archive noise |
| **pds** | AT Protocol Personal Data Server operations |
| **adr-skill** | Architecture Decision Records for agentic workflows |
| **frontend-design** | Production-grade UI that avoids generic AI aesthetics |
